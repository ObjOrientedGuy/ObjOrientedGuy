      <h4>Who am I?</h4>
      <p>
        Hi there, I am the ObjOrientedGuy and I am 16 yeard old. I live in the Netherlands
        and my hobbies are programming, gaming, skating.
      </p>
      <h4>What will you find on my website?</h4>
      <p>
        As you can see, the website is pretty empty at the moment. And it will take me some time
        to really get the website going, because I have not worked alot with websites in the past,
        but I am planning to tell you more about me and maybe also share my creations.
